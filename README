Maven GWT EAR project
=====================

It took me about a week to make all IDE and CLI components work together.

Key features
============

1. IDE Eclipse Indigo with plugins

2. Technology stack
- Maven 3
- GWT 2.4.0
- GXT 3-beta2
- GWTP 0.6
- JPA (Hibernate 4.0.1) 
- Envers audit (from Hibernate)

3. EAR application with simple deployment to GlassFish 3.1.1
- EJB module
- WEB module (GWT client + server)

4. Great development tools:
- JRebel Social (deployment takes seconds and completely automatic)
- Eclipse debug on external server (easy debug of EAR app on external GlassFish)
- GWT Development mode debug on external server (Throw out Jetty, debug your GWT on GlassFish)

Notes
=====
Deployment to server works only after jpauc-ejb mvn packaging.
Compiling gwt to src/main/webapp. It's required for eclipse WTP deployment 
and GWT debug.

Eclipse plugins are presented on the screenshots in the root directory.
